# SMAP
This is the code for the android app to a wearable project using a HTML framework (Cordova). 
##Project description:
SMAP is a dive into critical design and addresses the inhibited communication of our modern society in a funny and cheeky way. More at [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/41107007/SMAP)
I do not recommended to use Covdova for a mobile project anymore.
